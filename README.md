Implementing Web Push notifications with Service Workers in a NuxtJS App.
We turned IG Academy content into a PWA, using a server-side JS application and  enabling caching of its main assets (CSS/JS), and serving the files on bundled minimised HTML/CSS/JS from a VueJS app.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
